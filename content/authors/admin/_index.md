As the scale and scope of biomedical data exponentially increase, machine learning is becoming a crucial part of scientific discovery. In my graduate work at Yale University in the [Krishnaswamy Lab](https://krishnaswamylab.org/), I have developed graph-based representation learning approaches that learn from the graph structure and reveal patterns that characterize cellular and molecular behavior, especially from single-cell sequencing data. My research is highly interdisciplinary, and I have led several high-impact collaborations with multiple departments and institutions, spanning a broad range of research areas.

This work has appeared in journals such as Nature, Science Immunology, Cell Patterns, and Cell Trends in Immunology, and is in review at Genome Research, Nature, and Nature Computational Science. Additionally, my work has been accepted at notable computer science and graph signal procesing conferences, including SampTA, LoG, GSP, and ICASSP.
